<h1>Luhn Algorithm</h1>
This Python script implements the Luhn Algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm. It is a simple checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, particularly credit card numbers.

Features:
Luhn Algorithm Implementation: The script takes a credit card number input and applies the Luhn Algorithm to validate it.
Input Validation: It checks whether the input contains only numeric characters before proceeding with the algorithm.
Checksum Verification: The algorithm verifies whether the calculated checksum is divisible by 10, indicating a valid credit card number.

How It Works:
Input Credit Card Number: Enter a credit card number as input.
Luhn Algorithm Application: The script applies the Luhn Algorithm to the input number.
Validation: If the calculated checksum is divisible by 10, the credit card number is considered valid; otherwise, it's invalid.
